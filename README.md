# 4od-ad-block
Simple chrome plugin to block ads on 4od. Working as of 26 October 2015.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Download the adblocker.crx file
2. In chrome, open the extensions page (either through the menu -> more tools -> extensions), or type chrome://extensions in the url bar
3. Drag the adblocker.crx file from explorer onto the extensions page, and click yes to install

Done!

All ads should be blocked. Sometimes the ad client will try several times to load ads, so there might 5-10 second delays during ad breaks.
